# Contribution Guide

There are many ways to be an open source contributor, and we're here to help you on your way! You may:

- Propose ideas in our
  [discussion forums](https://forums.tbd.website)
- Raise an issue or feature request in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/TBD54566975/ftl/issues)
- Help another contributor with one of their questions, or a code review
- Suggest improvements to our Getting Started documentation by supplying a Pull Request
- Evangelize our work together in conferences, podcasts, and social media spaces.

This guide is for you.

## Development Prerequisites

The tools used by this project are managed by
[Hermit](https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/), a self-bootstrapping package
installer. To activate the Hermit environment, cd into the source directory and
type:

```
$ . ./bin/activate-hermit
```

> **Tip:** Install Hermit's [shell hooks](https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/usage/shell/) to automatically activate Hermit environments when you `cd` into them.

If using an IDEA IDE we highly recommend installing
the Hermit [IDEA plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16882-hermit).
For most other editors, starting your editor from within a terminal in an
activated Hermit environment is the best way to ensure the editor's environment
variables are correctly set. eg. for VSCode:

```
$ . ./bin/activate-hermit
$ code .
```

Once the Hermit environment is activated you can type the following to start a
hot-reloading ftl agent:

```
$ ftl dev ./examples/echo ./examples/time
```

You can then view the console at `http://localhost:8892`

## Best practices

### Sum types

We're using a tool called go-check-sumtype, which is basically a hacky way to
check that switch statements on certain types are exhaustive. An example of that
is schema.Type. The way it works is that if you have a type switch like this:

```go
switch t := t.(type) {
  case *schema.Int:
}
```

It will detect that the switch isn't exhaustive. However, if you have this:

```go
switch t := t.(type) {
  case *schema.Int:
  default:
    return fmt.Errorf("unsupported type")
}
```

Then it will assume you're intentionally handling the default case, and won't
detect it. Instead, if you panic in the default case rather than returning an error,
`go-check-sumtype` will be able to detect the missing case. A panic is usually
what we want anyway, because it isn't a recoverable error.

TL;DR Don't do the above, do this:

```go
switch t := t.(type) {
  case *schema.Int:

  // All other cases
  default:
    panic(fmt.Sprintf("unsupported type %T"))
}
```

## Communications

### Issues

Anyone from the community is welcome (and encouraged!) to raise issues via
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/TBD54566975/ftl/issues)

### Discussions

Design discussions and proposals take place on our [discussion forums](https://forums.tbd.website).

We advocate an asynchronous, written debate model - so write up your thoughts and invite the community to join in!

### Continuous Integration

Build and Test cycles are run on every commit to every branch on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/TBD54566975/ftl/actions).

## Contribution

We review contributions to the codebase via GitHub's Pull Request mechanism. We have
the following guidelines to ease your experience and help our leads respond quickly
to your valuable work:

- Start by proposing a change either in Issues (most appropriate for small
  change requests or bug fixes) or in Discussions (most appropriate for design
  and architecture considerations, proposing a new feature, or where you'd
  like insight and feedback)
- Cultivate consensus around your ideas; the project leads will help you
  pre-flight how beneficial the proposal might be to the project. Developing early
  buy-in will help others understand what you're looking to do, and give you a
  greater chance of your contributions making it into the codebase! No one wants to
  see work done in an area that's unlikely to be incorporated into the codebase.
- Fork the repo into your own namespace/remote
- Work in a dedicated feature branch. Atlassian wrote a great
  [description of this workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)
- When you're ready to offer your work to the project, first:
- Squash your commits into a single one (or an appropriate small number of commits), and
  rebase atop the upstream `main` branch. This will limit the potential for merge
  conflicts during review, and helps keep the audit trail clean. A good writeup for
  how this is done is
  [here](https://medium.com/@slamflipstrom/a-beginners-guide-to-squashing-commits-with-git-rebase-8185cf6e62ec), and if you're
  having trouble - feel free to ask a member or the community for help or leave the commits as-is, and flag that you'd like
  rebasing assistance in your PR! We're here to support you.
- Open a PR in the project to bring in the code from your feature branch.
- The maintainers noted in the `CODEOWNERS` file will review your PR and optionally
  open a discussion about its contents before moving forward.
- Remain responsive to follow-up questions, be open to making requested changes, and...
  You're a contributor!
- And remember to respect everyone in our global development community. Guidelines
  are established in our `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
