# Welcome to your new FTL Project!

Now you have a project you can start to add modules. 
You can add a new Kotlin module called `hello` by running one of the
language specific commands below:

```shell
ftl new kotlin hello
ftl new go hello
ftl new java hello
```

For more information on how to get started and what to do next please
