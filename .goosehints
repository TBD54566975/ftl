# FTL project

This project is the ftl (faster than light) platform. 

# first steps always:

always run this first: . ./bin/activate-hermit && hermit install to prepare env

`just build ftl` is also a useful starting point.

to run tests, for example: `just test-backend` is a good place to start, also look in the Justfile.

## Building

### Standard Build
```bash
just build ftl
```

### Debug Build
```bash
FTL_DEBUG=true just build ftl
```

### Live Rebuild (for local testing)
```bash
just live-rebuild
```

## Running

### Development Mode
```bash
ftl dev --recreate ./examples/go
```

### With OpenTelemetry
1. Start OTEL stack:
   ```bash
   just observe
   ```

2. Run FTL with OTEL:
   ```bash
   just otel-dev
   ```

## Debugging

### Using Delve

1. Start debug session:
   ```bash
   just debug <args>
   ```
   This provides a debug endpoint at 127.0.0.1:2345

2. Attach debugger:
   - IntelliJ: Run "Debug FTL" from Run/Debug Configurations
   - VSCode: Run "Debug FTL" from Run and Debug dropdown

## Testing Local Changes

1. Start live rebuild:
   ```bash
   just live-rebuild
   ```

2. In another terminal, test against a separate project:
   ```bash
   ${FTL_HOME}/build/release/ftl dev
   ```

## VSCode Extension Development

### Building
```bash
just build-extension
```

### Packaging
```bash
just package-extension
```

### Publishing
```bash
just publish-extension
```

## Database Changes

1. Generate SQL code:
   ```bash
   just build-sqlc
   ```

2. Create new migration:
   ```bash
   dbmate new <migration_name>
   ```

## Useful Tips

- Use `rg` (ripgrep) for searching code:
  ```bash
  # Find files by name
  rg --files | rg example.py
  
  # Search content
  rg 'class Example'
  ```

- Access Grafana dashboard at http://localhost:3000 when running OTEL stack

- For local testing, always run FTL from the project root directory
