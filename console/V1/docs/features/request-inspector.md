### **Request Inspector Requirements:**

1. **Detailed View:**

   - **Functionality:** Allow users to select and inspect individual requests.
   - **Viewable Components:**
     - Headers: Display all request and response headers.
     - Payloads: Display the request payload (body) in a readable format. Provide options to view in raw or formatted (pretty-printed) versions.
     - Responses: Display the response body. As with payloads, offer both raw and formatted view options.
   - **Interactivity:** Options to expand/collapse sections for better readability.
   - **Accessibility:** Ensure that the detailed view is easily accessible from the main console or log management section.

2. **Real-time Debugging Console:**

   - **Live Feedback:** As users send test calls, the console should instantly display the result. This includes the request made, the response received, and any associated metadata.
   - **Error Highlighting:** If the test call results in an error, this should be prominently displayed. This includes error messages, status codes, and any other relevant information.
   - **Discrepancy Identification:** If the response or behavior does not match expected outcomes, these discrepancies should be highlighted for the user's attention.
   - **Interactive Elements:** Provide options for users to retry requests, modify them, or navigate to related logs or events.

3. **Integration with Other Features:**
   - **Log Management:** Users should be able to navigate from specific logs to the detailed view of a request in the Request Inspector.
   - **Test Call Management:** After sending a test call, users should be able to inspect it in detail using the Request Inspector.
