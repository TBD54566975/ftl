# Log Management

1. **Filter & Search Logs:** Advanced filtering options and a search functionality to quickly locate specific events or anomalies.
2. **Trace Event Flow:** Visual representation of event flow through Verbs and modules, highlighting interactions and dependencies.
3. **Surface Errors:** Prominent display of errors occurring within Verbs and modules.

To break this down further into more detailed steps:

### **Filter & Search Logs:**

1. **Search Bar:** Implement a search bar that allows users to type in keywords, event IDs, module names, or specific error messages.
2. **Advanced Filters:** Provide options to filter logs by:
   - Date and Time range.
   - Specific Modules or Verbs.
   - Error type or severity.
   - Event type (e.g., API calls, database queries).
3. **Pagination & Scrolling:** Ensure that users can easily navigate through large amounts of logs. Offer infinite scrolling or paginated views.

### **Trace Event Flow:**

1. **Visual Timeline:** Display logs in a timeline format, with each log entry represented as a point or node.
2. **Highlight Interactions:** Use arrows or lines to connect related log entries, indicating the flow of events.
3. **Module & Verb Highlight:** Differentiate logs originating from different Modules or Verbs using colors or icons.
4. **Zoom & Pan:** Allow users to zoom in and out of the timeline for detailed inspection or a broader overview. Provide panning options for navigating across the timeline.

### **Surface Errors:**

1. **Error Highlight:** Use bold, colors, or flashing icons to make error logs stand out prominently in the timeline.
2. **Error Details:** On clicking an error log, display a detailed view with:
   - Error message.
   - Stack trace (if available).
   - Affected Module and Verb.
   - Suggested solutions or links to relevant documentation.
3. **Error Aggregation:** Group similar error logs together, providing a count and allowing users to expand and view individual errors.

### **Integration with Request Inspector:**

1. **Detailed View Link:** For each log, provide a link or button that takes the user to the Request Inspector for a detailed view of the request, including headers, payloads, and responses.
2. **Contextual Highlighting:** In the Request Inspector, highlight sections of the request that correspond to errors or anomalies identified in the logs.
