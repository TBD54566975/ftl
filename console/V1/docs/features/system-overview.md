# System Overview requirements

## Perspectives:

1. **Top-Down**
2. **Functional Flow**
3. **Historical Evolution**
4. **Performance or Load Paths**
5. **Layer-Sequence (Middle-Out)**

Here's a structured approach to explore a system using these perspectives:

### 1. **Initialization (Top-Down)**

- **Controller Overview:** Start with the controller to understand the primary functionalities and the main modules it interacts with.
- **Module Dive:** Dive into each module to understand its primary verbs and their purposes.

### 2. **Functional Flow Exploration**

- **User Journey:** Map out typical user journeys and understand which modules and verbs get triggered in the process.
- **Data Flow:** Visualize the flow of data between modules, especially if there are any databases or external services involved.

### 3. **Historical Evolution**

- **Module Evolution:** Understand when and why each module was introduced. This provides context about the system's growth and the reasons behind certain design choices.
- **Verb Evolution:** Within modules, see how verbs have been added, modified, or deprecated over time.

### 4. **Performance or Load Paths**

- **Hot Paths:** Identify paths that are most frequently used or that handle the most significant amounts of data.
- **Bottlenecks:** Using performance metrics, pinpoint modules or verbs that might be performance bottlenecks.

### 5. **Layer-Sequence Perspective (Middle-Out)**

- **Layer Visualization:** Picture each module on its own layer, similar to tracks in a video editing software. This will give you a spatial understanding of how modules are stacked in terms of their interactions.
- **Interaction Sequence:** On this layered visualization, draw lines or arrows to signify interactions between modules, but instead of just static lines, these should be sequenced based on when they happen.
- **Time Scrubbing:** Implement a time-scrubbing feature, allowing you to move back and forth through time to see how interactions evolve. This is particularly useful to track events across modules.
- **Zoom and Explore:** As you scrub through time, you might find areas of interest (e.g., a particular surge in interactions). You should be able to zoom into these areas to understand them from all the previously mentioned perspectives.

Implementing this comprehensive exploration will involve a combination of static visualizations (like diagrams and charts) and interactive tools (like the time-scrubbing feature). Depending on the complexity of your system and the tools at your disposal, this could be a sizable project in itself.

Would you like to delve deeper into any particular aspect, or discuss potential tools and techniques to achieve this?

# Layer-sequence perspective (Middle Out)

This approach should allow for a comprehensive understanding the a controller and it's modules. This method not only accounts for the static snapshot of the system at a given moment but also but also for the dynamic flow of interactions over time.
